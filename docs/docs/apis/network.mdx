# Network

:::info
The network api is currently only available when the [network capability](../components/Devtools) is enabled.
:::

The network api grants access to network requests made by the browser session. Internally, it uses [`chrome.devtools.network`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/devtools/network) to retrieve initial requests from the HAR log when your webpage connected to the devtools and append subsequent requests using [`onRequestFinished`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/devtools/network#event-onRequestFinished).

## `useNetwork`

The `useNetwork` hook returns three values:
* `requests`: an array of request objects.
* `onRequestFinished`: a function that accepts a callback to execute when a network request is finished.
* `clear`: a function to clear the network requests.

### Reading all requests

:::warning
Iterating over all requests on every re-render is extremely expensive, expecially with ES modules dev server like [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) where there can be thousands of requests to render a single page.

We recommend reading `requests` on the first render and then using `onRequestFinished` for all subsequent requests.
:::

```tsx
const {requests} = useNetwork();

return (
  <View>
    {requests.map(request => request._resourceType)}
  </View>
)
```

### Intercepting requests

In some cases, it may be useful to intercept network requests and execute an action in your application (snapshotting state, extracting a cache, etc).

```ts
const {onRequestFinished} = useNetwork();

useEffect(() => {
  const result = onRequestFinished((request) => {
    // Hypothetical example of refreshing a GraphQL cache
    // when intercepting new GraphQL queriesin the network tab
    if (
      request._resourceType === 'fetch' &&
      request.request.method === 'POST' &&
      request.request.postData.mimeType === 'application/json'
    ) {
      const requestBody = JSON.parse(request.request.postData.text);
      const isGraphQLQuery =
        requestBody.operationName &&
        requestBody.query &&
        requestBody.variables;

      if (isGraphQLQuery) {
        refreshCache();
      }
    }
  });

  return () => {
    result.then((unsubscribe) => unsubscribe());
  };
}, [onRequestFinished, refreshCache]);
```
