# Status

Aside is currently in its **beta phase**. We will strive to not break the API, but a lot of features still need to be built and expanded on and breakage might happen. The project is rapidly transitioning from a scrappy prototype coded from the couch to a robust, well-tested, well-documented and thought fully designed product.

The roadmap to version 1.0 is available [here](https://github.com/alxclark/aside/issues/24) and is subject to change.
